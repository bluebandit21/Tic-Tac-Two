General notation:
m_n denotes an m-dimensional tic-tac-toe game, whose rows are all of length n.
The goal of this project is to be able to check if a given tic-tac-toe board has a winning line
(that is to say, a line of constant offset and length n whose values are all O or X), 
and more generally, if a game of m_n is possible to stalemate. 
(That is to say, have no lines consisting of only Os  or Xs)

Board Variables:
Dimension->m
Row_size->n
Byte_count-> The size of the board in bytes, which could be potentially useful.
Dimension_cache-> An array of size  row_size that contains the bit offsets used for each row.
Board-> The pointer to the start of the board data.


Data storage:

Board is composed of array of char characters. 
Each position on the board uses two bits of data. 
Bit 1 signifies whether the position has been set yet. (0->unset)
Bit 2 signifies O or X, with 0 corresponding to O.
All data is initialized to 0 at the start, so it is safe to assume that positions will be 00 until modified.
